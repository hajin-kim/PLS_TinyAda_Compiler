	The Token class represents tokens in the language.
	For simple syntax analysis, a token object need only
	include a code for the tokenâ€™s type,
	such as was used in earlier examples in this chapter.
	However, a token can include other attributes,
	such as an identifier name, a constant value,
	and a data type, as we will see in later chapters.
